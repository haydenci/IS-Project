        <h1 class="title">Were Ancient Israelites Monotheistic?</h1> 
        <p>
            Many Christians will say that the ancient Israelites were strictly monotheistic. Is this true? 
            Let's look at some Bible verses that will help us answer this question:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li><span class="bold">Genesis 1:1</span>
                <ul>
                    <li>"In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth."</li>
                    <li>In this verse, the word used for God in the Hebrew is <span class="black-italic">Elohim</span>. This word is a plural form of the word for God. This is why the verse also uses the possesive pronoun "our." This suggests the existence of mulitple distinct divine beings.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><span class="bold">Exodus 20:3</span>
                <ul>
                    <li>"Thou shalt have no other gods before me."</li>
                    <li>This is the first commandmant of the Ten Commandments given to Moses on Mount Sinai. The question is, who would God deem it necessary to tell the ancient Israelites not to have any other gods before Him if they didn't even exist? Wouldn't it be easier for Him to simply explain that to them?</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><span class="bold">Deuteronomy 32:8-9</span>
                <ul>
                    <li>"When the Most High gave to the nations their inheritance, when he divided mankind, he fixed the borders of the peoples according to the number of the sons of God. But the Lord's portion is his people, Jacob his allotted heritage."</li>
                    <li>What this verse is stating is that the High God ("<span class="black-italic">Elyon</span>") divvied up the nations of men to the Sons of God ("<span class="black-italic">Bene Elohim</span>") he gave the nation of Israel to the LORD ("<span class="black-italic">YHWH</span>" or "<span class="black-italic">Yahweh</span>" or "<span class="black-italic">Jehovah</span>"). It is important to note that in the Old Testament, the phrase "<span class="black-italic">Bene Elohim</span>" never refers to humans, and always refers to divine beings. Something interesting to note is that in older translations (Like in the KJV, I quoted the newest ESV translation) instead of Sons of God, it says Sons of Israel. This is because when the Dead Sea Scrolls were discovered, they said Sons of God. Scholars date the Dead Sea Scrolls as an earlier, and thus a more accurate copy of the Old Testament. They also attribiute the fact that the newer manuscripts we have say "Sons of Israel" ("<span class="black-italic">Bene Yishrael</span>") to people changing the original text in order to better suit the later developed thology of hard monotheism.</li>
